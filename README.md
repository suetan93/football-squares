# Football Squares

Every year I host a game of Super Bowl Squares with my friends. I usually set it up on a Google Sheet to allow everyone to participate virtually. For Super Bowl LV, I decided to build an app for it instead. I also explored using MongoDB Atlas as a cloud database as well as deploying through Heroku. Both platforms were simple to implement and get connected to. This was a fun project and I enjoyed working through the styling and being able to bring something I do with my friends and family to life.

Features I would like to implement in the future:
  * Real time scores and updates through a public API
  * Real time winner tracking
  * Allow users to style font and color


## Technologies
 * React
 * CSS
 * Node.js
 * MongoDB Atlas
