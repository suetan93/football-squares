# Football Squares

Every year I host a game of Super Bowl Squares with my friends. I usually set it up on a Google Sheet to allow everyone to participate virtually. For Super Bowl LV I decided to build an app for it instead!

Alot more features I would like to implement such as real time game scores and updates on current winner.
