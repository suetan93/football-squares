# Football Squares

Every year I host a game of Super Bowl Squares with my friends. I usually set it up on a Google Sheet to allow everyone to participate virtually. For Super Bowl LV I decided to build an app for it instead! I enjoyed being able to to play around with different colors and layouts. I deployed using Heroku.

Features I would like to implement in the future:
  * Real time scores and updates through a public API
  * Real time winner tracking
  * Responsive columns
  * Allow users to style font and color
